# Kelp: Restaurant Reviews Application

> Scaled backend of the reviews microservice for a restaurant reviews application. Through modifying the database schema, adding a Redis caching layer, horizontally scaling a dockerized container of the server, and sharding a MongoDB, this microservice was able to increase throughput from 500 RPS to 6200 RPS
